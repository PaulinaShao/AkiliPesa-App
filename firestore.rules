/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AkiliPesa Mobile-Money Integration (Automated Payout Engine)
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure authorization model based on user ownership and admin roles.
 * It provides flexible data shapes, allowing for rapid iteration without strict schema enforcement,
 * except for critical fields required for authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data (profiles, clones, agents) is nested under /users/{userId}.
 * - Public or shared data (posts, products, orders, payments, calls, transactions, admin settings, admin agents)
 *   is stored in top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Admin access is granted based on email verification using request.auth.token.email,
 *   specifically checking for "blagridigital@gmail.com".
 * - Public read access is granted only to collections explicitly intended for public consumption.
 * - Write permissions always require authentication and are restricted based on ownership or admin roles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To avoid costly `get()` calls, critical data such as ownership (e.g., authorId, ownerId, agentId) is
 * denormalized directly into documents.  This enables fast, simple rules without extra database reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, while public data resides in top-level collections.
 * This approach provides better security and performance for list operations compared to using a single
 * collection with a boolean flag for visibility.
