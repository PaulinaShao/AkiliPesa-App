/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AkiliPesa Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection with an ownership-based access control model.
 * Users can only access their own data unless explicitly specified otherwise.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public data (e.g., posts, products) resides in top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to owner-only access.
 * - Denormalization: Ownership is enforced by requiring `ownerId` or `authorId` fields in documents that are otherwise publicly accessible.
 *
 *  Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   To create simpler, more performant rules, denormalize (copy) data required for an authorization decision directly onto the documents being secured. This avoids slow, costly, or impossible security checks.
 *  Structural Segregation:
 *  When data can be both private and public (e.g., drafts vs. published content), prefer using separate collections (a private user subcollection and a public top-level collection).
